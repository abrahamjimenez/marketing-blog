## What is Drop-Shipping?

Drop-shipping is a business model, where you, as the retailer, don't keep the products you sell in stock. You are the middleman between the buyer and the manufacturer.

## Should you choose Drop-shipping or E-commerce?

You should choose [E-commerce](e-commerce.md) if you have the products in hand. You do not need to be a manufacturer to sell your product, but you can be.
